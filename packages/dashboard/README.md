# @latexmk/dashboard

A development Preact/Vite administration console for the remote-latexmk job
queue, server capabilities, and administrator user/token management. It is not
included in the root Compose quick start or embedded in the server.

```sh
pnpm --filter @latexmk/dashboard dev
```

The development server proxies `/v1` to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Set
`LATEXMK_API_ORIGIN` to change the proxy target, or set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` when
the deployed API uses a different origin. The token is stored only in the
operator's browser local storage.

When Dashboard and API have different origins, configure the API with the
Dashboard's exact origin in `LATEXMK_CORS_ORIGINS`. A same-origin reverse proxy
does not need this setting.
